# PoliQ

---

## Project Origin

The **PoliQ solution** was created in response to the growing demand in the political and civic sectors for **user-friendly and powerful data analysis tools**. 

Recognizing the limitations of traditional data interpretation methods—which often require technical expertise, time, and resources we aimed to build an innovative solution that streamlined and simplified this process.

The team collaborated with **PoliQ**, which already operated an analytical platform called **PoliMap**, used by advocacy groups and legislators. The project aimed to significantly enhance PoliMap by integrating a **natural language chatbot interface** and **large language models (LLMs)**—making political and civic data insights more accessible to a broader audience.

## Project Objectives

- Integrate **cloud and local LLMs** to interpret and respond to user queries
- Build a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline for enhanced context awareness
- Use **prompt engineering** to generate reliable, insightful natural language responses
- Develop a web application powered by **FastAPI**, **PostgreSQL**, **MongoDB**, and **React**

---

## Technologies & Tools Used

- **Languages & Frameworks**: Python, FastAPI, JavaScript, React
- **AI & NLP**: OpenAI, local LLMs, RAG pipelines, prompt engineering
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL (structured), MongoDB (unstructured), VectorDB
- **Others**: Git, Miro (architecture design), Agile collaboration

## Learning Outcomes

- Gained hands-on experience integrating **LLMs into full-stack web apps**
- Built secure, scalable **multi-agent systems** to handle diverse query types
- Applied **retrieval-augmented generation** techniques for dynamic knowledge sourcing
- Improved collaboration, version control, and agile development practices in a real-world team setting
